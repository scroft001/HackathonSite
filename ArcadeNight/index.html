                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 18px; padding: 10px;">Each participant brings in a game they made on <a style="color: darkorange" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. They can bring in the game as an offline version that will run on offline Scratch or use the internet to log into their Scratch account and pull the game up. They are then the arcade masters controlling their station. A player comes up, hands the participant a quarter to play. Once the lives are up or the player loses their turn is over. Want to play again? Pay the developer another quarter. The game creator can choose to stand by their station to accept the money and give directions to the player, or set up a jar to do the collecting and run about playing the other games.</p>

                <h2>Why Scratch?</h2>
                <p style="line-height: 1.5em; font-size: 18px; padding: 10px;">
                    Scratch is a very basic visual blocks editor used to create video games. It is super easy to learn and start building interactive games that will run anywhere in a browser. Why is this a good program to use at an arcade night? Most schools that have a "coding club" use Scratch to introduce their students to coding. At Hackingtons we use it as a stepping stone for the younger students to start learning the basics of code. It is widely known in the education sector meaning most kids will have heard of it. It is wildly popular which increases the turn out as most kids know Scratch and can build "a totally awesome game that will make me a lot of money".
